    <h1>JS slider example page</h1>
    <p>The slider will automatically advance a slide every 5 seconds unless the user manually interacts with the slide control buttons. Slide control buttons are hidden until mouseover. Slide controls are locked during transition for stability purposes.

    Set data-speed and data-size on the slider element to set custom image size and rate of automatic progress.
    </p>
